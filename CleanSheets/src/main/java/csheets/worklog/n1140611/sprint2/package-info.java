/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the work of the team member (1140611)
 * Carlos Santos during week2.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>-Note: this is a template/example of the individual documentation that
 * each team member must produce each week/sprint. Suggestions on how to build
 * this documentation will appear between '-' like this one. You should remove
 * these suggestions in your own technical documentation-</b>
 * <p>
 * <b>Scrum Master: -(yes/no)- no</b>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Area Leader: -(yes/no)- yes</b>
 *
 * <h2>1. Notes</h2>
 *
 * -Notes about the week's work.-
 * <p>
 * -In this section you should register important notes regarding your work
 * during the week. For instance, if you spend significant time helping a
 * colleague or if you work in more than a feature.-
 *
 * <h2>2. Use Case/Feature: IPC05.1</h2>
 * Issue in Jira:
 * <a href="http://jira.dei.isep.ipp.pt:8080/browse/LPFOURDG-63">LPFOURDG-63</a>
 * <p>
 * -Include the identification and description of the feature-
 *
 * <h2>3. Requirement</h2>
 * Add an option that can be used to send text messages to another instance of
 * Cleansheets.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Use Case " Chat Send Message ":</b> Add an option that can be used to send
 * text messages to another instance of Cleansheets. The message should be
 * displayed in a popup window in the other instance of Cleansheets. The popup
 * should disappear after some short period (for instance 5 seconds).
 * Cleansheets should have have a new sidebar window to display all the
 * messages. The sidebar should be based on a tree control that shows the
 * messages grouped by thread of conversation (i.e., each reply will be a child
 * of the parent message). It should be possible to reply to a message by double
 * clicking on it in the tree.
 *
 *
 * <h2>4. Analysis</h2>
 * <h3>Send Message</h3>
 * The user selects "Send Message" option in the "Chat Application" menu. The
 * system gets the other available instances in the local network, and presents
 * them in a sidebar window. The user selects which instance to send the
 * message. The system gets message, and sends them to the targeted instance.
 * The system notifies the other user with a popup with 5 seconds time. The
 * system put message in a tree control and save the history of message by
 * conversation
 *
 *
 * <h3>First "analysis" sequence diagram</h3>
 * The following diagram depicts a proposal for the realization of the
 * previously described use case. We call this diagram an "analysis" use case
 * realization because it functions like a draft that we can do during analysis
 * or early design in order to get a previous approach to the design. For that
 * reason we mark the elements of the diagram with the stereotype "analysis"
 * that states that the element is not a design element and, therefore, does not
 * exists as such in the code of the application (at least at the moment that
 * this diagram was created).

 *
 * <h4>Receive Message proposal analysis</h4>
 * <p>
 * <img src="doc-files/chat_app_analysis_receive.png" alt="image">
 * <p>
 *
 * From the previous diagram we see that we need to add a thread for each
 * conversation. Using a thread manager we can disable a thread when itÂ´s
 * necessary This is the core technical problem regarding this issue.
 *
 * <h3>Analysis of Core Technical Problem</h3>
 * The core of communication is expected to communicate in udp and tcp protocols
 * connections.
 * <p>

 *
 *
 * <h2>5. Design</h2>
 *
 * <h3>5.1. Functional Tests</h3>
 * Basically, from requirements and also analysis, we see that the core
 * functionality of this use case is to be able to send and receive messages.
 * <p>
 * see: <code>csheets</code>
 *
 * <h3>5.2. UC Realization</h3>
 * To realize this user story we will need to create a subclass of Extension. We
 * will also need to create a subclass of UIExtension. For the sidebar we need
 * to implement a JPanel. In the code of the extension
 * <code>csheets.ext.chatApp</code> we can find examples that illustrate how to
 * implement these technical requirements. The following diagrams illustrate
 * core aspects of the design of the solution for this use case.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> It is very important that in the final version of this technical
 * documentation the elements depicted in these design diagrams exist in the
 * code!
 *
 * <h3>Chat send Message</h3>
 * The following diagram shows the setup of the local connection when
 * cleansheets's user select share.
 * <p>
 * <img src="doc-files/ipc05.1_design.png" alt="image">
 *
 *
 * <h3>Receive Message</h3>
 * The following diagram illustrates what happens when a instance of cleansheet
 * receive message.

 *
 * <h3>5.3. Classes</h3>
 * <p>
 * <b>Class Diagram</b>
 * <p>
 * Global Class Diagram
 * <p>
 * <img src="doc-files/ipc05.1_classdiagram.png" alt="image">
 * <p>
 * -Document the implementation with class diagrams illustrating the new and the
 * modified classes-
 *
 * <h3>5.4. Design Patterns and Best Practices</h3>
 *
 * -Describe new or existing design patterns used in the issue-
 *
 * Observer: This Pattern is used to notify SharePanel with new instances in
 * local network and received cells.
 *
 * <h2>6. Implementation</h2>
 *
 * -Reference the code elements that where updated or added-
 * <p>
 * -Also refer all other artifacts that are related to the implementation and
 * where used in this issue. As far as possible you should use links to the
 * commits of your work-
 * <p>
 * see:
 * <p>
 * <a href="../../../../csheets/ext/chatApp/package-summary.html">csheets.ext.chatApp</a><p>

 *
 * <h2>7. Integration/Demonstration</h2>
 *
 * -In this section document your contribution and efforts to the integration of
 * your work with the work of the other elements of the team and also your work
 * regarding the demonstration (i.e., tests, updating of scripts, etc.)-
 *
 * <h2>8. Final Remarks</h2>
 *
 * -In this section present your views regarding alternatives, extra work and
 * future work on the issue.-
 * <p>
 * As an extra this use case also implements a small cell visual decorator if
 * the cell has a comment. This "feature" is not documented in this page.
 *
 *
 * <h2>9. Work Log</h2>
 *
 * -Insert here a log of you daily work. This is in essence the log of your
 * daily standup meetings.-
