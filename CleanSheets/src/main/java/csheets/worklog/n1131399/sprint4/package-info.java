/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the work of the team member (1131399)
 * Marcelo Barroso during week4.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Scrum Master: no</b>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Area Leader: no</b>
 *
 * <h2>1. Notes</h2>
 * <p>
 * All the work was done as planned. Initially it was necessary to do some
 * refatoring of some use after case, due to the fact they are not fully
 * functional, affecting the performance of my use case. After being done with
 * my feature I've helped to implement CRM02.1 Address Edition, CRM06.3 Tasks,
 * Reminders, Events, IPC 08.1 File Sharing and also discussing Analysis and
 * Design with my teammates of their respective feature.
 * </p>
 *
 *
 * <h2>2. Use Case/Feature: CRM04.3</h2>

 * <h2>3. Requirement</h2>
 * The chat extension should now support the concept of chat room. A chat room
 * can have several participants. Messages in a chat room are broadcasted to all
 * its members. The user that creates a chat room becomes its owner. There are 2
 * types of rooms: private rooms and public rooms. Public rooms are announced to
 * all instances of Cleansheets and each user is free to become a member of a
 * public room. A private room is not announced in the network. The owner should
 * send invites to other users to participate on the room. Each user is free to
 * accept or reject the invitation. The sidebar should now display also the chat
 * rooms.
 *
 * <h2>4. Analysis</h2>
 * Initially I started by analyzing the Volt framework used throughout the
 * development team and how it would help me in implementing the requested
 * requirement. I analyzed the code so far produced by my colleagues and
 * although it complies with the requirements so far solictiados, this new
 * delivery will not be possible to use, so it is necessary refatoring which
 * already affects the time it is not much to implement the new requirement.
 * With regard to my use case does not raise many questions, and so its
 * implementation after refatoring, more or less quiet. Users can send messages
 * to the rooms, but for this, they must send a message to the "owner" of this
 * room and know who is in it, doing so for the message order for all classroom
 * participants. The "owners of the rooms" will share their public rooms in
 * broadcast with the network.

 *
 * From the previous diagram we see that we need to add a thread for each
 * conversation. Using a thread manager we can disable a thread when itÂ´s
 * necessary.
 *
 * <h3>Analysis of Core Technical Problem</h3>
 * The core of communication is expected to communicate in udp and tcp protocols
 * connections.

 * <h2>5. Design</h2>
 *
 * <h3>5.1. Functional Tests</h3>
 * Since this feature uses the network framework already implemented any tests
 * needed to be done are done on that level. For the realization of this use
 * case I only use/call this framework methods.
 *
 * <h3>5.2. UC Realization</h3>
 * To realize this user story we will need to create a subclass of Extension. We
 * will also need to create a subclass of UIExtension. For the sidebar we need
 * to implement a JPanel. In the code of the extension
 * <code>csheets.ext.chatApp</code> we can find examples that illustrate how to
 * implement these technical requirements. The following diagrams illustrate
 * core aspects of the design of the solution for this use case.
 *
 * <h3>Chat send Message</h3>
 * The following diagram shows the setup of the local connection when
 * cleansheets's user select share.

 * <h3>Receive Message</h3>
 * The following diagram illustrates what happens when a instance of cleansheet
 * receive message.
