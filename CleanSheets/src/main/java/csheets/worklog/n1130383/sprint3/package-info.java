/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the work of the team member (1130383) Pedro
 * Gomes during week3.
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Scrum Master:</b> no</p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Area Leader:</b> no</p>
 *
 * <h2>1. Notes</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * During this week the work went well as planned. First days dedicated to
 * Analysis and Design, then the Test phase and finally the feature
 * Implementation. While implementing the first Analysis and Design solutions,
 * new concepts were added and therefore changing the previews phases. Most of
 * the time were invested in implementing my feature and global discussion.</p>
 *
 * <h2>2. Use Case/Feature: Ipc02.2</h2>
 *
 * <b>Issue in Jira:</b>
 * <p>
 * <a href="http://jira.dei.isep.ipp.pt:8080/browse/LPFOURDG-55">LPFOURDG-55</a></p>

 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>3. Requirement</h2>
 * <p>
 * The sidebar window that displays the results of the search should now include
 * an area to display a preview of the contents of a workbook when the user
 * selects it (i.e., clicks on it). The preview should be based on the values of
 * the first non-empty cells of the workbook. This preview should be produced
 * without open the worksheet (at least without the worksheet been opened in the
 * user interface). The search should now be based on a pattern and not only on
 * the file name extension.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Use Case - Workbook Search:</b> The user indicates a pattern and a
 * directory to search for workbooks that resembles the pattern. The search
 * should be performed accordingly and while Cleansheets application is fully
 * available, therefore it should be performed as a background search. The user
 * can one-click over a specific Workbook found to see a preview or/and
 * double-click to open the Workbook on Cleansheets application.</p>
 *
 *
 * <h2>4. Analysis</h2>
 *
 * <p>

 **<p>
 * <img src="doc-files/ipc02.2_analysis.png" alt="Class Diagram Analysis"></p>
 *
 * The Classes to implement are similar to other Extensions that also use a Side
 * Bar plus Classes that handle these feature required algorithms.<ul>
 * <li><b>AWSExtension:</b> This class contains data regarding the Extension:
 * Name, Version. It also provides access to this UIExtension, required to load
 * the Extension in the main User Interface of the application, and will extend
 * the Extension Class, as all other Extensions. (All inheritance will be
 * available further on this page).
 * </li>
 * <li><b>AWSUI:</b> Extends UIExtension as all other Extensions UI. It will
 * provide the Side Bar.</li>
 * <li><b>AWSPanel:</b> This class is the actual Side Bar Panel and will contain
 * all components to interact with the User to perform the implemented features
 * â€“ Searching for a Workbook, open a preview or/and open the Workbook to the
 * current workspace. This Sidebar, aside from Buttons and Text Fields, has also
 * a DefaultListModel to contain all searched files and a DefaultTableModel to
 * contain all data regarding the Workbook Preview.</li>
 * <li><b>AWSController:</b> Class in charge of handling the Search and
 * providing the results to AWSPanel. It will also communicate with
 * WorkbookPreview and retrieve a preview of the given Workbook.</li>
 * <li><b>WorkbookPreview:</b> This Class builds a preview according the
 * Workbook received from AWSController. The preview is a 5*5 rectangular area
 * delimited by an upper left corner and a lower right corner. The first Cell
 * with content will fulfil the position (0; 0) and will serve as a reference
 * for the other cells. This class works as a <b>service</b> who builds 5*5
 * preview for any non-corrupted Workbook. The size of the preview can easily be
 * changed.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Analysis of the core problem/functionality:</h3>
 * <p>
 * From the analysis made above, and the set of requirements needed for this
 * feature, the core functionality is to provide the user the ability to not
 * only search for workbooks in a specific directory but also to see a preview
 * of the found workbooks without performing the actual "opening" to the current
 * workspace. This feature will save time and will enhance the experience with
 * the application.</p>
 *
 * <h2>5. Design</h2>
 *
 * <h3>Functional Tests</h3>
 * <p>
 * Tests can be made for class <code>WorkbookPreview</code> in order to evaluate
 * the previwed cells and if it correspond to the given workbook. There can also
 * be tests for the method that searchs for workbooks in the current machine. In
 * order to do so there must be a testing class for <code>AWSController</code>
 * and <code>WindowPreview.</code></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For the <code>WorkbookPreviewTest</code> there are tests created to all
 * methods that handle internal behavior, no UI association. In the
 * <code>setUp()</code> method a new Workbook (wb) and a new Spreadsheet(ss) is
 * initialized and the <b>middle</b> of that spreadsheet (second spreadsheet of
 * the workbook - position 2) will be filled with content equal to 1. It's
 * important to fill the results in the middle to test the algorithm that
 * searchs for the first non-empty cell. The WorkbookPreview provides a preview
 * of the Workbook - a matrix (5*5) of cells - where the first position of this
 * matrix will be the first non-empty cell from a workbook, even if the first
 * cell with content isn't in the first Spreadsheet, it could be in the second,
 * third... Therefore the first cell of the preview should have content equal to
 * 1, according to the values used to test. After the spreadsheet setup, a
 * different Workbook will be used to create a second Preview, in the method
 * <code>testGetPreview()</code>, but this time from the its first spreadsheet.
 * This new spreadsheet, unlike the first one used, will be filled from its
 * first Cell, manually. The Preview obtained is the <b>expected result</b> and
 * should have the same values as the other. If the values from both Previews
 * match the tests are successful. This tests are essentially to test if, for
 * the Workbook given, the algorithm is correctly looking for the first
 * non-empty cell, no matter its place in the Workbook, and if the group of
 * cells returned is a 5*5 matrix grouped by the first non-empty Cell.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For the <code>AdvancedWorkbookSearchController</code> there are tests to all
 * methods that handle searching features. By providing a temporary folder and a
 * specific pattern - Default pattern in this test - the controller is able to
 * search for all files in the giving directory.<pre>
 * {@code
 *		//Allow to set up a Temporary Folder for Testing.
 *		'@Rule'
 *		public TemporaryFolder temporaryFolder = new TemporaryFolder();
 *
 *		//File under the Temporary Folder.
 *		public File file;
 *}
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In the method <code>testSearch()</code> the variable 'file' is initialized
 * with a file with the ".cls" extension (the default pattern when no other is
 * provided) from the TemporaryFolder. The search algorithm returns a List(File)
 * with the found files. If the list returned contains the file under the
 * TemporaryFolder then the tests are successful.</p>
 * <p>
 * The method <code>setUpWorkbookPreview()</code> is also tested to guarantee
 * that the correct columns are being used to build the Preview. The first
 * correct column should be where the first non-empty cell is located. The
 * others should be the four next.</p>
 * <p>
 * Both classes were tested for this feature requirements and are fully
 * functional.</p>

 * <h3>Design Patterns and Best Practices</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * Singleton Pattern implemented by ExtensionManager.</p>
 * <p>
 * Low Cowpling - High Cohesion.</p>
 *
 * <h2>6. Implementation</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * This feature side bar provides the major interaction with the user and access
 * to its functionalities.The user is able to specify a directory to perform the
 * search and a pattern on how the search is based on. Two <b>Text Labels</b>
 * will be implemented alongside with 2 buttons:<ul>
 * <li><b>"..." button</b> - Opens a Directory Dialog. The user chooses a
 * directory on the machine.</li>
 * <li><b>"Search" button</b> - Starts a background search based on the
 * information provided. At this moment a second thread performs the search
 * while all features are available - asynchronous operation.</li>
 * <li><b>A Grid</b> - (DefaultTableModel) will be implemented on the side bar
 * Extension. It will be a preview of one of the selected workbooks showing a
 * group of cells. The list of possible selected workbooks will be displayed
 * below the grid showing all workbooks found.</li>
 * <li>Also a <b>List</b> - (DefaultListModel) that will contain all Files found
 * from the Search</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b> Final Version of the Side Bar:</b></p>
 * <p>
 * <img src="http://i.imgur.com/p3T6ZeR.png" alt="Side-Bar"></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Top-Right Corner has a Gif that is enabled while the Search is running
 * (Search algorithm).</p>
 * <p>
 * <img src="http://i.imgur.com/nY7q5uw.png" alt="Side-Bar-Search-Indicator"></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, without providing any pattern, the application is set to search
 * for all files that contain the extension ".cls".</p>
 * <p>
 * The Developing of this feature was mostly straight forward, after the
 * Analysis and the Design, all code was implemented as expected and according
 * to tests. There was no need to change any solutions or the taken path. Aside
 * from an important update on a malfunction of the UI. Both Diagrams provide
 * the full picture on how this feature Work.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The WorkbookPreview was implemented to set up a Preview for any non-corrupted
 * Workbook. The Algorithm makes use of Iteration to look for the first
 * non-empty cell in all Spreadsheets available. The cell is saved and used as a
 * reference to export the content of a block of cells to create the
 * preview.</p>
 * <p>
 * The AWSController Search Algorithm searchs for Files in a given Directory and
 * makes use of Recursivity to search on the Sub-Directories of that Directory
 * and so on. For the pattern system the java.util.regex package was used for
 * matching the given pattern with regular expressions and to validate them.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Regarding the asynchronous Process the approach was to start a new Thread to
 * handle the Search. The code presented below is the solution on how the
 * problem was solved:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * 		private void performSearch() {
 *		if (validateDirectory(directory)) { //validates directory.
 *				pattern = jPatternField.getText();
 *			if (validatePattern()) {//validates pattern.
 *			list.clear(); //clears previous results.
 *			Runnable newthread = new Runnable() { //new Thread
 *				public void run() {
 *					cont = 0;
 *					jImagePanel.setVisible(true);
 *					files = controller.search(directory, pattern);
 *					checkDuplicatedFiles(); //sets up a list without duplicated files.
 *					postSearchUIOperations(); //required operations after each Search.
 *				}
 *			};
 *		new Thread(newthread).start(); //starts the new Thread.
 *			}
 * ...
 *		} ...
 *	 }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * <h2>7. Integration/Demonstration</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * During this week I focused more on my individual feature while still being
 * available for anyone who needed. All IPC team had great members and the
 * Demonstration worked really well.</p>
 *
 * <h2>8. Final Remarks</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * After the Demonstration a crucial update on this feature side bar was made
 * and commited to fix a malfunction on the Search Button as well as selecting a
 * directory.
