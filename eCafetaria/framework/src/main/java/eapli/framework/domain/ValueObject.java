/**
 * A value object is a Domain-Driven Design pattern for domain concepts which do
 * not have a thread of continuity neither need to be tracked by their identity
 * but for the value of its attributes. these are immutable objects which can be
 * freely shared and discarded and replaced by another instance. equality is
 * done thru comparison of the attributes' values.
 *
 * Typical examples are:
 * <p>
 * - Address (in most scenarios)
 * <p>
 * - Color
 * <p>
 * - CustomerNumber
 * <p>
 * - Money
