/**
 * An entity is a Domain-Driven Design pattern for concepts in the domain which
 * have a thread of continuity which needs to be tracked. these concepts matter
 * by their identity and we need to track them continuously. instance equality
 * must be done thru the identity of the objects and we cannot loose track or
 * allow duplication of an entity
 *
 * Typical examples are:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Product
 * <li>Person
 * <li>Account
 * </ol>
